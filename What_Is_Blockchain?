->Distributed?

If my transactions are distributed then I get below questions-

-> Is it secure since it's distributed?
-> How te security implemented?
-> It's normal that a distributed system has replicatio  for recovery and quick read then how many replication we need to keep?
-> If one of the node / system on which txn haas to replicate is crashed then how it'll recover within how much time?
-> Distributing the records / txn needs time then how can this system gives seemless or quick or fast experience to customers?
